Ratings are hard. And lots of rating systems kind of suck. When everything is rated between 7.5 and 8.5, how do you actually differentiate anything? What about products that are highly niche but still have a place? 

Answer: just rate more, dawg.

# The Rating System, at a high level

Every product reviewed on this site will have ***three*** **overall scores**: an **objective** score, a **subjective** (preference) score, and a **value** score.

Except for the value score-- which is wholly my personal opinion-- each score is taken as the average score of the categories defined in the subsections at the bottom of the page to the nearest whole star.

Each subsection is scored on a scale from 0-3:

- 0 stars: cannot recommend this product.
- 1 stars: can recommend this product, but does not stand out.
- 2 stars: excellent. A solid recommendation.
- 3 stars: the best of the best.

A mouse I do not personally enjoy using might have a low overall subjective score. However, if it is built well and has great sensor performance, it will still have a good objective score. This hopefully gives you, the reader and potential consumer, an optimal way to judge the merits of a product.
