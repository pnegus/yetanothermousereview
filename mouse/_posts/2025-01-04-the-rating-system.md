I like simple ratings. But ratings can be hard. Too granular, and you end up with reviews that are overly glowing, with ratings that average a 7.5 or 8. Too simple and you end up just... not rating things correctly.

# The Rating System

To try and minimize the headache of the everlasting pile of crap that is rating things, as well as keeping my readers from wanting to yell at me on the internet for my subjective opinions, I will be rating mice from 1-3 stars in the following categories:

- Build Quality (objective)

- Button Quality (objective)

- Sensor and Click Performance (objective)

- Shape (subjective)

- Ingame performance (subjective)

- Value (subjective)

Consequently, every product reviewed on this site will have ***two*** **overall scores**: an **objective** score and a **subjective** (preference) score.

For example, a mouse I do not personally enjoy using might have low subjective scores. However, if it is built well and has great sensor performance, it will still have a good objective score. This gives you, the reader and potential consumer, a better way to judge the merits of a product.
