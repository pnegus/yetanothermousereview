Ratings are hard. And lots of rating systems kind of suck. When everything is rated between 7.5 and 8.5, how do you actually differentiate anything? What about products that are highly niche but still have a place? 

Answer: just rate more, dawg.

# The Rating System, at a high level

Every product reviewed on this site will have ***two*** **overall scores**: an **objective** score and a **subjective** (preference) score. This score is taken as the floor of the average (to the nearest 1/2 star) score of the categories defined in the following subsections.

For example, a mouse I do not personally enjoy using might have low subjective scores. However, if it is built well and has great sensor performance, it will still have a good objective score. This gives you, the reader and potential consumer, a better way to judge the merits of a product.


## Categories for Mice
