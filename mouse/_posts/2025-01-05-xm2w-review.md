The Endgame Gear XM2W 4KHz is a symmetrical, medium-sized gaming mouse designed for claw grip. It is the successor to the XM1/R, and has a PAW3395 sensor. This mouse was tested on the latest firmware (1.06) with the following settings:

- 800 DPI
- 1000hz
- SPDT OFF
- Slam Click Filter ON
- Motion Jitter Filter ON

## Build Quality

Endgame Gear is generally known for having excellent build quality and quality control, and that extends to my white unit. There is no creaking, rattling, or flexing to be had with the shell of the XM2W. 

Furthermore-- and this is a rarity-- the XM2W base is more or less perfectly flat. You should have no problem using this mouse on a glass mousepad.

Build Quality Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Button Quality

Button quality on the XM2W is not quite as stellar as its build, but still good nonetheless. There is a small amount of pretravel on LMB, and the side buttons are reasonably tactile and clicky. Worst of the bunch is the scroll wheel click-- while while not bad by any means-- has a slight amount of inconsistent pretravel depending on the wheel position (a common issue due to scroll wheels not always having straight stems) and consequently can be more difficult to press at times. 

The scroll wheel is excellent, with well defined steps. 

Button Quality Rating: ★☆☆ **Good**

## Sensor Performance

Shown below are Interval vs. Time graphs (a graph of the amount of time elapsed between each piece of sensor data received) and XSum vs. Time graphs (a graph of the cumulative number of x-direction sensor counts received, which allows for measuring sensor latency against another test subject-- in this case, a Pulsefire Haste 2), taken using Mousetester 1.4

The XM2W 4K is capable of three polling rates: 1000Hz, 2000Hz, and 4000Hz.

Save for some elevated noise, polling is stable at all polling rates.

Interestingly, there is no significant difference in sensor latency across all polling rates. Sensor latency in and of itself is stellar-- matching the Pulsefire Haste 2-- making it the fastest wireless mouse I have ever tested.

Sensor Performance Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Click Latency

Testing TBD using Nvidia Reflex. But in general, click latency is extremely low, with zero noticeable delay ingame.

Click Latency Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Software

Software for the XM2W 4K can be obtained from the Endgame Gear Website [here](https://www.endgamegear.com/en-us/downloads/xm2w-4k).

It is an extremely lightweight application that is similar in functionality to softwares such as Logitech OMM (Onboard Memory Manager), where you toggle your desired settings and close the application when you're done-- there's nothing here to run in the background and suck up CPU cycles.

As such, I personally think that this software-- as ugly as it is-- is the absolute gold standard for mouse configuration software. Although one might argue that a web app would be even better, in the (relatively unlikely) event that the mouse company providing said web app goes defunct, one would be completely DOA. Not so with light executables such as that provided by EGG.

Software Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**


## Mouse Feet

The XM2W ships with one set of smaller mouse feet installed, and another set of larger feet in the box.

Unfortunately, neither are of commendable quality. Glide is quite fast, but not particularly smooth, and the mouse feet suffer from excessive x/y deviation. This deviation should eventually go away with significant use, but at brief inspection these stock skates are harder than most high quality aftermarket offerings, which means that you will be dealing with x/y deviation for quite a while if you decide to stick with the stock mouse feet. 

Mouse Feet Rating: ☆☆☆ **Cannot Recommend**

## Clickfeel

The XM2W's main switches are developed in collaboration with Kailh, called Kailh GX switches. These switches are novel in that they are SPDT switches-- not only are they capable of detecting actuation faster than typical mechanical/optical switches, but by nature they should also effectively eliminate any possibility of double clicking.

In practice, these switches are good, if not outright excellent. If memory serves, these are not far off in terms of feel from the Kailh 8.0s of the XM1R. They do not compete with the best of the best of current offerings, such as the Omron Optical implementations on mice like the Lamzu Atlantis Mini Champion Edition, but they are more than serviceable for spamming and tapping in game, with a good amount of tactility and return force.

Click latency is extremely low, as 

# Personal experience and thoughts

I test all my gaming mice in Kovaaks and Valorant with the following settings:

- MotionSync disabled
- 1KHz polling
- 400 dpi (251.2 total eDPI in Valorant)
