Welcome to Yet Another Mouse Review! This blog is my foray into making high-quality written reviews about gaming hardware (mice, mousepads, and audio). I started reviewing on Youtube ([@yetanothermousereview](https://www.youtube.com/@yetanothermousereview)), and I intend to continue to post videos there (as time and motivation permits), but my main focus will be on this site. 

I have 3 primary goals when writing reviews here:

- Thoroughness. All mice will be tested rigorously, from build quality to sensor performance to handfeel. 

- Objectivity. If I receive mice for review, receipt of said mice will not impact the timing nor the content of the review (though, every review I've done as of the writing of this post has been on hardware I have purchased with my own cash). 

- Entertainment. I hope to keep things light around here. My writing can sometimes be terribly terse so it's something I want to work on. If you have feedback for me, disagree with me, or have any requests, send them off to `yetanothermousereview@gmail.com`. I look forward to any and all correspondence!
