The Vaxee X Ninjutso Sora is a medium-sized symmetrical mouse designed for claw grip. It was tested with the latest available firmware (the one shipped out of the box), and retails for US $139.99.

## Build Quality | Objective

Vaxee, like Endgame Gear, is 

Furthermore-- and this is a rarity-- the XM2W base is more or less perfectly flat. You should have no problem using this mouse on a glass mousepad.

Build Quality Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Button Quality

Button quality on the XM2W is not quite as stellar as its build, but still good nonetheless. There is a small amount of pretravel on LMB, and the side buttons are reasonably tactile and clicky. Worst of the bunch is the scroll wheel click-- which while not bad by any means-- has a slight amount of inconsistent pretravel depending on the wheel position (a common issue due to scroll wheels not always having straight stems) and consequently can be more difficult to press at times. 

The scroll wheel is excellent, with well defined steps. 

Button Quality Rating: ★☆☆ **Good**

## Mouse Feet

The XM2W ships with one set of smaller mouse feet installed, and another set of larger feet in the box.

Unfortunately, neither are of exceptional quality. Glide is quite fast, but not particularly smooth, and the mouse feet suffer from excessive x/y deviation. This deviation should eventually go away with significant use, but at brief inspection these stock skates are harder than most high quality aftermarket offerings, which means that you will be dealing with x/y deviation for quite a while if you decide to stick with the stock mouse feet. 

Overall, these are serviceable mouse feet, but I recommend finding aftermarket options.

Mouse Feet Rating: ★☆☆ **Good**

## Coating

On release, the XM1/R set the benchmark for gaming mouse coatings. Even though half a decade has passed since, it remains a benchmark for top-tier mouse coatings. I'm pleased that this coating remains unchanged with the XM2W.

Compared to my Vaxee XE-S which has the colored, non-soft-touch coating, it is slightly grippier when dry and significantly grippier when your hands are sweaty. 

**Which is to say that it remains one of the grippiest mice on the market in all conditions**. 

One point of concern is wear on the coating of white mice. My white XM1R showed some minor signs of wear and discoloration over time. Assuming that the coating composition here remains unchanged, this may also be a potential issue.

Coating rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Sensor Performance and Click Latency

Shown below are Interval vs. Time graphs (a graph of the amount of time elapsed between each piece of sensor data received) and XSum vs. Time graphs (a graph of the cumulative number of x-direction sensor counts received, which allows for measuring sensor latency against another test subject-- in this case, a Pulsefire Haste 2), taken using Mousetester 1.4 and MouseComparator. 

*Note that these plots are a little noiser than they will be in future reviews, as I did not set core priorities/affinities when taking these measurements.*

The XM2W 4K is capable of three polling rates: 1000Hz, 2000Hz, and 4000Hz.

Save for bursts of variance in polling, polling is stable at all polling rates.

Interestingly, there is no significant difference in sensor latency across all polling rates. Sensor latency in and of itself is stellar-- matching the Pulsefire Haste 2-- making it the fastest wireless mouse I have ever tested.

When it came to click latency, I performed bump testing against the Pulsefire Haste 2. The XM2W had approximately 3.5-4ms less click latency without the SPDT modes enabled. With GX speed mode, click latency is reduced further, but is not recommended to be used due to the risk of accidental clicks.

In any case, this is a phenomenal result, though you will almost certainly not notice a difference if you already have a modern gaming mouse.

Sensor Performance and Click Latency Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Software

Software for the XM2W 4K can be obtained from the Endgame Gear Website [here](https://www.endgamegear.com/en-us/downloads/xm2w-4k).

It is an extremely lightweight application that is similar in functionality to softwares such as Logitech OMM (Onboard Memory Manager), where you toggle your desired settings and close the application when you're done-- there's nothing here to run in the background and suck up CPU cycles.

As such, I personally think that this software-- as ugly as it is-- is the absolute gold standard for mouse configuration software. Although one might argue that a web app would be even better, in the (relatively unlikely) event that the mouse company providing said web app goes defunct, one would be completely DOA. Not so with light executables such as that provided by EGG.

Software Rating: ★★★ **Top Tier**

## Clickfeel

The XM2W's main switches are developed in collaboration with Kailh, called Kailh GX switches. These switches are novel in that they are SPDT switches-- not only are they capable of detecting actuation faster than typical mechanical/optical switches, but by nature they should also effectively eliminate any possibility of double clicking.

In practice, these switches are good, if not outright excellent. If memory serves, these are not far off in terms of feel from the Kailh 8.0s of the XM1R. They do not compete with the best of the best of current offerings, such as the Omron Optical implementations on mice like the Lamzu Atlantis Mini Champion Edition, but they are more than serviceable for spamming and tapping in game, with a good amount of tactility and return force.

Click latency is extremely low, as 

# Personal experience and thoughts

I test all my gaming mice in Kovaaks and Valorant with the following settings:

- MotionSync disabled
- 1KHz polling
- 400 dpi (251.2 total eDPI in Valorant)
