The Waizowl Cloud OGM V2 Hawkeye 8KHz-- or the Cloud V2 as I will henceforth be referring to it as-- is a symmetrical wireless gaming mouse designed for right-handed users. The selling point of this mouse is its shape; it is close copy of the famed Steelseries Sensei.

This mouse was tested on the firmware it was shipped with. I am not aware of any more recent firmware updates.

# Unboxing

# Shape

Please note that my following thoughts on mouse shape are entirely subjective; my grip style, hand size, and aiming style all influence my preference for shape. For reference, I grip my mouse with an aggressive claw grip and I have 19.5x11cm hands.

The Cloud V2 has a shape that closely resembles the famed Steelseries Sensei. I cannot confirm as to whether it is a true 1:1 clone, but having owned the Nixeus Revel, I can say that it indeed comes quite close.

As such, this shape is quite comfortable to use in claw grip, though I find the mid-hump to be less suited for my particular grip, especially when it comes to micro-adjustments. 

# Personal experience and thoughts

I test all my gaming mice in Kovaaks and Valorant with the following settings:

- MotionSync disabled
- 1KHz polling
- 400 dpi (251.2 total eDPI in Valorant)
