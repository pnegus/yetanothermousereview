Welcome to Yet Another Mouse Review! This blog is my foray into making high-quality written reviews about gaming hardware (mice, mousepads, and audio). I started reviewing on Youtube ([@yetanothermousereview](https://www.youtube.com/@yetanothermousereview)), and I intend to continue to post videos there (as time and motivation permits), but my main focus will be on this site. 

I have 3 primary goals when writing reviews here:

- Thoroughness. All products will be tested rigorously, from build quality to performance to handfeel. 

- Utility. I have attempted to separate my subjective impressions of products from their objective aspects in the way I structure my reviews in order to maximize your ability to determine what products are best *for you*. Obviously, these are my reviews at the end of the day-- I cannot and will not be entirely objective. But, the goal is for my reviews at the end of the day to be of use to you as you consider whether a product might be a good fit or not.

- Entertainment. I hope to keep things light around here. My writing can sometimes be terribly terse so it's something I want to work on. If you have feedback for me, disagree with me, or have any requests, send them off to `yetanothermousereview@gmail.com`. I look forward to any and all correspondence!
