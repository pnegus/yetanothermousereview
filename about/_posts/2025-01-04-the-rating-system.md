Ratings are hard. And lots of rating systems kind of suck. When everything is rated between 7.5 and 8.5, how do you actually differentiate anything? What about products that are highly niche but still have a place? 

Answer: just rate more, dawg.

# The Rating System, at a high level

Every product reviewed on this site will have ***three*** **overall scores**: an **objective** score, a **subjective** (preference) score, and a **value** score.

The objective and subjective score for each product will be evaluated as a weighted average of their respective subsections as defined in the below sections.

Each subsection is scored on a scale from 0-10:

- 0: the worst product in this category
- 5: an average product for this category
- 10: the best product in this category

A mouse I do not personally enjoy using might have a low overall subjective score. However, if it is built well and has great sensor performance, it will still have a good objective score. This hopefully gives you, the reader and potential consumer, an optimal way to judge the merits of a product.

The value score will be on a scale of 0-3 stars:

- ☆☆☆ 0 stars: N/A; not a value recommend
- ★☆☆ 1 stars: a reasonable, solid recommendation for the price
- ★★☆ 2 stars: an excellent recommendation for the price
- ★★★ 3 stars: a complete steal
