# Conclusion and Value

The XM2W 4K is, in my opinion, one of the better mice you can purchase in 2025. Aside from its mediocre stock skates and minor nitpicks in build quality, it nails practically every tangible you could desire on a modern gaming mouse, while also having stellar sensor performance.The shape is, in my opinion, a little outdated, but it is still more than serviceable. The weight is also quite competitive for a TacFPS gaming mouse.

At $130 on Amazon US, it's an easy recommendation if you've used and liked the XM1 in the past. I wouldn't call it a value champion at that price, but at the same time-- $130 for a high-quality and well built gaming mouse is nothing to scoff at.
